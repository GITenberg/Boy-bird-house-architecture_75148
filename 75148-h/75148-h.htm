</div>

<p>It is with much pleasure that I commend to
the public this little book regarding the construction
of Bird Houses. As Instructor in
Nature Study at the Fairbanks Museum it
has been my privilege and pleasure to co-operate
closely with Mr. Baxter’s work in the
manual training department of the local
schools. Through his instruction our boys are
proud to be considered natural guardians of
bird homes in our town, which is veritably a
bird sanctuary. About two hundred suitable
nesting boxes have been placed in proper localities
during the past three years.</p>

<p>The Museum offers prizes each year to the
boys of Mr. Baxter’s classes and our exhibit of
Bird Houses on the first Saturday in April is
an event that attracts many proud parents to
inspect the work of their children.</p>

<p>In this little book, Mr. Baxter tells very
explicitly just how any one can build suitable
houses to attract our native birds.</p>

<p>Just here I would like to say that any town
or community that protects its birds, insures
its harvests against destruction by insect pests.
Therefore the economic value of Bird Houses
is even greater than the aesthetic. The results
actually accomplished by Mr. Baxter along
these lines vouch for the accuracy of the information
contained in this little book.</p>

</div>


<p>To the lover of the open, the woods, the
fields, and waterways and all of God’s wild
things, this book is affectionately dedicated.</p>

<p>To lead the boy and girl toward their
proper relationship with their feathered
friends of the air, and to instil the feeling of
protection toward our native birds, these
pages have been written and these designs
made.</p>

<p>What is offered between the covers of this
little book is the results of study and observation
of birds and their ways covering a period
of six years.</p>

<p>Each drawing offered is of a proven house,
one that has served as a home for some of our
songsters and if the directions, here set down,
are faithfully followed, equal success will
crown the builders’ efforts.</p>

<p>While the greater part of the text is the
result of knowledge which the writer has
gleaned at first hand, yet the author has several
times quoted from the text of the Farmers’
Bulletin No. 621, United States Department
of Agriculture, and from a contribution
by Edward Howe Forbush, in Bulletin No. 1,
published by The National Association of
Audubon Societies. Fig. <a href="#image015_2">2</a>, the photograph
showing a blue bird entering a box, is by S.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OUR_FRIENDS_THE_BIRDS">OUR FRIENDS THE BIRDS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> has been positively proven that birds will
return annually in greater numbers to localities
where assistance, in the form of
nesting boxes, has been rendered by those interested
in bird welfare, than to those places
where no such provision has been made.</p>

<p>A progressive study of our native birds by
competent individuals, especially through the
United States Department of Agriculture in
its Farmers’ Bulletins, has shown very decisively
that the return made by our feathered
friends by ridding our gardens and orchards
of destructive worms and insects, is many
times as valuable as the small commission they
collect by sampling a berry or two here and
there.</p>

<p>Innumerable quantities of seeds of plants
and weeds which would otherwise overun our
gardens are eaten by the birds. This, together
with the fact that these same birds with their
brilliant plumage and beautiful songs, are a
valuable asset to our neighborhood, ought certainly
to impress us that they are deserving
of our assistance and protection. Assistance
is best afforded by preparing suitable houses
and feeding shelves for them, and also by placing
bits of string, horsehair, and other nesting
material convenient for them. Protection is
simple and may be limited to laws safeguarding
birds from harm, to killing off as many as
possible of the English sparrows, and to seeing
that cats are not allowed any undue opportunity
for harming them.</p>

</figure>

<p>The boy or girl who puts up boxes for the
birds to nest in, supplies them with drinking
and bathing places, and provides food for those
species which remain in winter, is certain of
an unfailing source of pleasure, which can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
never be known to any one who pursues them
with airgun and stones, or simply ignores
their presence. The chances are that the bird-loving
boy or girl will make the better citizen.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Birds_That_Adapt_Themselves_to_Nesting"><span class="smcap">Birds That Adapt Themselves to Nesting
Boxes.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There is quite a large number of birds
that easily adapt themselves to the artificially
made house. The main thing is to consider
the type of house that will appeal to the intended
tenants, one that approaches nearest to
their natural desires and nesting sites.</p>

<p>Bluebirds and house wrens are the easiest
to entice to the nesting box. Plain weather
stained boxes or those covered with bark have
proven to be the best type.</p>

<p>Purple martins nest in colonies but are
scarce now in contrast to their former numbers.
Tree swallows take to the boxes, but if
an occasion arises where they have a choice
between the box and a natural cavity, generally
the latter will be selected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">Fig. 2. Blue Bird Entering Box.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Chickadees and flickers take to the home-made
box and, sometimes the little screech
owl occupies one of the man-made residences.</p>

<p>He makes a worthy tenant, for as a mouser,
he is superior to the house cat.</p>

<p>Robin Red Breast is another easily attracted
native bird. Last year I put up a
robin shelf, similar to the ones shown in the
following drawings, and inside of fifteen minutes
Mr. and Mrs. Robin had hired the apartment
for the season and were soon busily engaged
in weaving the nest within fifteen feet of
where we were observing them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Bluebirds"><span class="smcap">The Bluebirds.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The eastern bluebird is a common inhabitant
of all States east of the Rocky Mountains
from the Gulf of Mexico to Southern Canada.</p>

<p>In the Mississippi Valley it winters as far
north as Southern Illinois, and in the East as
far as Pennsylvania. It is one of the earliest
northern migrants and everywhere is hailed as
a harbinger of spring.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">Fig. 3. Chickadee Feeding.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Domestic in habits, it frequents orchards
and gardens and builds close to human habitations.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#image012">1</a> shows a bluebird at the entrance to
an artificially hollowed tree trunk, feeding its
young. Fig. <a href="#image014">2</a> shows another bluebird about

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Robin"><span class="smcap">The Robin.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>To many the robin is the most cherished
of birds and is found throughout the States
east of the Great Plains, and is represented
farther west and south by slightly different
sub-species. It breeds far north through Canada,
and is found even in Alaska. It is quite
fearless and will occupy a bird shelf close to
human habitation. The robin, however, refuses
the enclosed house and therefore the
front and one side should be made open.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Titmice"><span class="smcap">The Titmice.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>These birds, although insignificant in size,
have enormous appetites and feed chiefly on
small insects and their eggs that wholly escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the search of larger birds. This bird, or some
of its sub-species, occupies the whole of the
United States north of the latitude of Washington
and extends into Canada.</p>

<p>In the eastern portion of the country the
best known and most widely distributed
species is the common black capped chickadee.
Fig. <a href="#image015">3</a> shows a chickadee feeding from the
hand.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Wrens"><span class="smcap">The Wrens.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The diminutive house wren frequents barns
and gardens and particularly old orchards in
which the trees are partially decayed. He
makes his nest in a hollow where perhaps a
woodpecker had a domicile the year before,
but he is a pugnacious character, and if he
happens to fancy one of the boxes put up for
bluebirds, he does not hesitate to take it. He
is usually not slow to avail himself of boxes,
gourds, tin cans, or empty jars placed for his
accommodation.</p>

</figure>

<p>The various species of wrens occupy more
or less the whole country from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. The wren is one of our most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
friendly birds and his presence should be encouraged
about every farm, village, and suburban
residence.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Woodpecker"><span class="smcap">The Woodpecker.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The woodpeckers are the true bird carpenters
and do a great amount of good in destroying
harmful insects and boring worms.</p>

<p>These birds are found most everywhere in
the United States, several species remaining
in the northern States throughout the year.</p>

<p>Two of the best known woodpeckers, the
hairy woodpecker and the downy woodpecker,
range over a greater part of the United States.</p>

<p>One of the larger woodpeckers familiar to
us all is the flicker, or golden winged woodpecker.</p>

<p>Most all of the woodpeckers will adopt the
artificial house, especially those hollowed out
of a split piece of limb.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Bird_House_Material"><span class="smcap">Bird House Material.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Great varieties of houses can be constructed
of half inch lumber and can be made
very attractive to the eye. Other material,
however, can be utilized.</p>

<p>The most natural Bird Homes, and such
as may often be provided with the least trouble,
are pieces of hollow limbs or small hollow
trunks of trees, or the old nesting holes of
woodpeckers. If no limbs with suitable cavities
are found, they may be made by taking
a piece of a limb, about eight inches in diameter
and fourteen to sixteen inches long, dividing
it in half, with a rip saw, from one end to
within three inches of the other, where the
cut is met by a right-angle cut from the side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
After this an entrance hole of the required size
is made through the shorter or front half.</p>

<p>The two halves are hollowed out, as shown
in Plate <a href="#image059">19</a>, so as to form a cylindrical cavity
about three and one-half inches in diameter
and ten inches deep; then the two halves are
placed together and held with screws or bolts.
A similar Bird Home is made by boring an
auger hole from one end of a piece of limb to
within a couple inches of the other, plugging
the bored end, and making an entrance hole
near the other end. These homes are adapted
to woodpeckers, bluebirds, house wrens, chickadees
and tree swallows. A little larger home
of the same type is required for crested fly
catchers and decidedly larger ones for the
flicker.</p>

<p>A good sized, deserted flickers’ home or
similar cavity provides a nesting place attractive
to the screech owl.</p>

<p>A piece of wooden tubing from a chainpump,
with the ends plugged, and an entrance
made in the side near the upper end, the tube
being covered with bark, makes a very good
substitute for a hollow limb.</p>

<p>If old and weather stained boards are used
in making the box houses, bark covering is
not absolutely necessary, but it adds to the
attractiveness, from both the birds’ and the
human standpoint, and bark affords a good
foothold for the birds as they alight at the
entrance. Woodpeckers especially should
have bark covered exteriors to their homes.</p>

<p>Dried gourds, hollowed out, and with an
opening made for an entrance, often attract
wrens and bluebirds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>While tin cans may be used, it is not
desirable, in the author’s opinion to make use
of this medium as tin becomes very hot in the
sun. If cans are used, care should be taken
to place them in shaded places. Flower pots
inverted, as illustrated in Plate <a href="#image059">19</a>, are suitable
for some of the smaller birds.</p>

<p>The old fashioned chimney having been replaced
by the modern chimney with small
flues, the chimney swifts may be provided with
suitable nesting quarters by building on the
roofs of barns or sheds, artificial chimneys of
wood.</p>

<p>Birds may not always respond promptly to
the first attempt at placing a Bird Box, but
the would-be landlord must not get discouraged.</p>

<p>Prepare some Bird Homes in as attractive
a manner as possible, keep a supply of water
for bathing and drinking at hand, and prevent
their being disturbed. Then watch for the results
that are almost sure to come.</p>

<p>Persistent and intelligent effort will bring
ultimate results, which will be sure to reward
the attempt. Experience is the best teacher.</p>

</div>


<p>As has been before stated, the best finish
for the outside of our Bird Houses is bark.</p>

<p>The writer has experimented with various
kinds of bark and has obtained the best results
with the bark from the cedar.</p>

<p>It is rough enough for the birds to obtain
a good foothold upon, it is very artistic in appearance,
cuts and bends very easily and can
be held with four ounce tacks.</p>

<p>A word should be said here about obtaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
this bark, as it should never be taken from
the living tree. Cedar posts are used very
much for supports in building and most any
contractor or mill man has quantities on hand.
These posts most always must have the bark
removed, especially the part to show above
ground, and the owners, I have found, are
glad to have the boys remove the bark from
them. Sometimes a fallen cedar will be found
in the woods and from it may be obtained all
the bark necessary for a number of boxes.</p>

<p>If the whole Bird Box is not to be bark
covered it is a good plan to see that the roof
is protected by bark.</p>

<p>The remaining portions of the house should
be stained or painted a very somber color, such
as dull gray, brown, or dark green. Avoid all
gloss paints as they reflect light and tend to
drive away rather than attract the birds.
Bright colors should also be avoided. A nicely
constructed Bird Box painted a brilliant red
with yellow trimmings or some other equally
absurd combination such as the writer has
seen, is a travesty on proper Bird House construction.
Gloss paints can be dulled by adding
turpentine.</p>

<p>Painted or stained houses should be put
out at least a month or more before the time
for the birds to arrive. This is to weather
them and remove all odors. It is a good plan
to put out Bird Boxes in the fall if possible,
and they are then in excellent shape for
spring use. Do not paint or stain Bird Boxes
on the inside.</p>

<p>Place the houses in quiet places, away from
the direct rays of the sun, high enough to be
out of the way of prowling cats or too inquisitive
human beings.</p>

</div>


<p>To successfully entice the birds to a man,—or
rather boy—or girl-made home, there are
certain rules which experience has proven we
must follow.</p>

<p>The drawings in this book have been made
as nearly correct as careful study of all available
data on the subject will allow. The author
feels confident that if the drawings, together
with the specifications that go with
them, are carefully followed the artisan will
be amply rewarded by finding all bird tenements
“let” as soon as the spring migration
and nesting season starts.</p>

<p>These houses and many of varied design
have been successfully built by pupils of the
seventh and eighth grades, with over 75 percent
of success in having them occupied.</p>

<p>The table given below gives the correct dimensions
for a variety of houses for different
birds.</p>

<p>The size of the opening is very important,
as it is essential that it be no larger than is
necessary for the bird for whom it is intended,
to conveniently enter.</p>

<p>The smaller birds will be bothered a great
deal by the English sparrow, who enters if
the opening is not kept very small.</p>

<p>It is considered by a majority of authorities
that a perch is not a help but a hindrance
at the opening. The sparrows alight there
and by their incessant chirping drive out or
annoy the more desirable occupants. Again,
the bluebird and most of the other song birds
can fly directly to the edge of the opening
and thus go in, while the sparrow, not quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
as clever, must first alight on the perch and
get his bearing before hopping in.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly important that there be
some means of cleaning out Bird Houses at
the season’s end or to remove any dead birdlings
during the season. This may be taken
care of by having either the roof or the bottom
hinged.</p>

<p>St. Johnsbury, Vermont, is very fortunate
in having a fine Museum of Natural Science
with a corps of very efficient workers on its
staff.</p>

<p>Every year the directors of the Museum donate
a substantial amount of prize money as
rewards for the best houses constructed for
birds by pupils of the grammar school.</p>

<p>The local Commercial Club, as well as
many of the merchants also, add generously
to the fund, so that the boys and girls, besides
having an incentive for helping their bird
friends from an economic standpoint, also
have a chance to profit financially.</p>

<p>Previous to starting work the Museum instructors
give interesting lectures on the necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
of providing all possible assistance for
the birds, and by mounted specimens show the
various birds that readily accept the artificial
houses. They also explain the entrance sizes
required by the different species, and go into
detail concerning ventilation, drainage, coloring
and placing of the houses.</p>

<p>Later on the children are taken on bird
walks, so as to study first hand the characteristics,
habitat, and difference in coloring of
the male and female of the various native
birds.</p>

<p>Original designs are encouraged, and with
discussions and good advice the work is
started. A stated amount of time is allowed
for completing the houses, and the material is
paid for by each pupil.</p>

<p>On the appointed day the houses are numbered
and grouped and are ready for the judging.</p>

<p>Three judges are appointed from among
people who are proficient to judge such an exhibit,
usually one of the museum instructors,
to judge the technical side, a carpenter or
mechanic, to judge the workmanship, and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
who is interested in art to take care of the
general design and appearance.</p>

</div>


<p>First decide upon the bird for which your
house is to be made and, referring to the drawings,
select the one which best suits your fancy.</p>

<p>Look the various pieces over and estimate
about how much lumber will be required, then
plan your work so as to cut your board with
as little waste as possible. Take pieces of a
similar width and get them out in one long
piece from your board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="image029" style="max-width: 40.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">Fig. 12. Putting Up a House.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Plane one edge of the board straight and
smooth and call this the working edge, or edge
from which all measurements are to be taken.
Square one end square with the working edge
and the surface. Measure from this square
end, the length specified on the drawing, and
square a line across the board, placing the try
square handle tight against the working edge.</p>

<p>Next take the cross-cut saw and saw carefully
just outside your line on the side away
from the piece to be cut off. Plane now back
to the line and no further. The width must
next be obtained either with a marking gage,
if you have one, set at the required distance,
or by measuring carefully with your ruler.</p>

<p>Now saw and plane to your line. Treat
each piece in this manner and mark with its
proper letter, to be ready for assembling later.</p>

<p>We shall consider, for illustration, that we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>are making the Blue Bird House shown in
Plate <a href="#image043">3</a>. We have our pieces all cut out and
numbered and shall now cut the shape of pieces
A, which are the front and rear of the house,
from our pieces that we have previously cut
8½ inches wide by 10 inches long.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Find the center of one end, which will be
one-half of 8½ inches or 4¼ inches. Measure
down on each side 4 inches and draw from
our edge center to these points.</p>

<p>Find the center of our bottom edge next
and measure 2½ inches each side to make
our bottom edge 5 inches wide, as shown.
Draw from the ends of this 5 inch lines to our
points on the sides and we are ready to carefully
cut out the form as shown in the drawing.
Always remember when sawing to a line
to leave about <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> inch between our saw cut
and the line and finish with a plane to the
line.</p>

<p>Be sure that the front and rear pieces are
exactly the same size and shape to insure our
house going together nicely later.</p>

<p>Take the bottom piece E and draw light
lines from corner to corner, and with a dot
locate the points where we are to bore our
drainage holes.</p>

<p>In boring these take care not to split
through on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Locate the holes for ventilation next and
bore these carefully.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Take our back brace F next and draw a
light pencil line from end to end, through the
center, and locate the holes for nailing to the
tree 1 inch in from either end. The holes for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>screwing piece F to the box are 3½ inches
beyond these outer holes. Bore carefully.</p>

<p>Bore the entrance hole with an expansive
bit set so as to bore a hole 1½ inch in diameter.
The center for this hole is 3 inches down
from the top and 4¼ inches from either side.</p>

<p>If the house is to be painted it should be
thoroughly sandpapered with No. ½ sandpaper,
going with the grain.</p>

<p>Take the sides and bevel them to fit the
front and back pieces, that is plane them so
that when they are placed in proper position
against the front and rear, the edges will follow
the same sweep as the eaves and the bottom
edge. All cutting should be finished before
sandpapering so as not to dull our plane
blade with the fine particles of sand left in the
wood by the sandpaper.</p>

<p>Nail the sides to the front and rear, using
1¼ inch brads, placing about five on each
edge, and taking care that they strike fair in
the center of the edge to prevent splitting.</p>

<p>Next nail on roof C, having the rear edge
flush with the rear of the box allowing all projection
to come in front. Have ridge edge just
level with peak. Next nail on roof B, seeing
that it overlaps and is nailed to the edge of C.</p>

<p>Next attach piece F to the rear of the box
with screws, allowing equal projection above
and below the box. Take the bottom E and
screw on an inch butt hinge to the under side
at the middle point of the rear edge. Then
place in position and screw the other part of
hinge to F, taking care that the bottom fits
tightly against the bottom edges of the box.</p>

<p>Retain in front by means of a small flat
hook and eye as shown.</p>

<p>Our box is now ready to be either painted
or covered with bark as desired.</p>

<p>If it is to be bark covered use a pair of
snip shears to cut the bark to the size required.
It is generally a good plan to cut the
bark a little large and trim off after attaching
it to the box. Use 4 oz. tacks, using as few as
possible. Have the bark run uniformly in the
same direction over the box. Bark directly
over all holes and when finished cut these out
with a sharp knife.</p>

<p>If a house is to be painted and have a bark
roof only, paint first and allow to dry, perhaps
giving a second coat and then place the
bark on the roof.</p>

<p>This same method of construction as described
will be practically the same for any of
the houses shown.</p>

<p>Lumber should be used that will withstand
the weather. Cypress, spruce and soft pine
are perhaps the best.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Winter_Care_of_the_Birds"><span class="smcap">Winter Care of the Birds.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If you wish to attract birds about the
house during the winter, do not wait until
the ground is covered with snow, but begin
in the Fall to scatter hayseed from the barn
or stable floor, on the bare ground about the
yard.</p>

<p>Millet or any bird seed will do as well.
Hang some pieces of suet or beef-trimmings
on the branches of the trees beyond the reach
of cats and dogs. If at first these pieces are
widely scattered at points radiating from the
house as a center, your success should be assured.
Your lures will keep best at this season
if tied on the shade side of a tree trunk;
but later in the winter they should be put on
the sunny side. They should be well wound
to limbs with twine, or covered with wire netting,
so that neither jays or crows can carry
them off bodily.</p>

<p>They are now ready to attract and hold
birds that might otherwise pass on to the
south. The birds may not find the food at
once, but usually they will find it sooner or
later. When the chickadees have discovered
it we are ready for the next move.</p>

<p>Fresh meat or suet is now put up on the
trees nearest the house, to accustom the birds
to coming there.</p>

<p>Many types of feeders can be made, varying
the plain wood shelf, to the artistic food shelters
of natural limbs and bark. Some feeders
can be placed on movable pivots on poles with
extended vanes in front so that the wind will
always cause them to be in a sheltered position.
This type of feeding shelf, Fig. <a href="#image015">4</a>, and
others are shown on Plate <a href="#image061">20</a>.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The window shelf shown on Plate <a href="#image061">20</a>, Fig.
<a href="#image012">1</a>, is convenient and can be easily watched
and tended. Fig. <a href="#image012">2</a> shows a feeding stick.
Melted suet is poured into the holes and allowed
to cool and the birds eat from the outside.</p>

<p>The cocoanut larder is inexpensive and
easily set up. One end of a cocoanut is broken
in as shown and the birds have access to the
meat. Fig. <a href="#image015">4</a> is one type of rustic feeder which
has proven popular.</p>

<p>The following birds have been attracted
about local feeders: Chickadees, Fig. <a href="#image014">3</a>, nuthatches,
woodpeckers, juncos, and even the
wary jay, Fig. <a href="#image034">13</a>. Figure <a href="#image036">14</a> shows a simple
form of feeding shelf with sides of glass. A
hairy woodpecker can be seen just below the
upper box.</p>

<p>Corn, suet, scraps of meat, crumbs from
the table, pieces of doughnut, nuts, sunflower
seed, frozen milk and many other food materials
may be utilized, if one wishes to experiment.</p>

<p>These methods of attracting and domesticating
the birds will be found full of interest,
and in some cases our efforts will be rewarded
by having some little feathered ball jump fearlessly
on our fingers for a choice titbit.</p>

<p>The birds will furnish instruction and
amusement to the household throughout the
year and a vast amount of good may be accomplished
in this manner, adding greatly to the
comfort and happiness of our wild bird
friends.</p>
